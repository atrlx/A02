# Glossary
- Branch — a separate line of work where you can change things without breaking the main project.
- Clone — downloading a GitHub repository to your computer so you can work on it locally.
- Commit — a saved snapshot of your changes with a message.
- Fetch — ask the remote for new commits; it brings metadata down but doesn’t change your files yet.
- GIT — the version control system that tracks changes to files.
- Github — the website/service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud.
- Merge — combine changes from one branch into another.
- Merge Conflict — when Git can’t automatically combine changes and asks you to choose what to keep.
- Push — send your local commits up to GitHub.
- Pull — bring down commits from GitHub and update your local files (pull = fetch + merge).
